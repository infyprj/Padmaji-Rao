**1. Start with the overview:**

> "In my part of the project, I worked on showing the product details to users and also showing 3d product to user, which makes the experience more interactive and realistic."

**2. Explain step-by-step what you did:**

* **Loading product info:**
  "First, I get the product data and images from the server using the product's ID."

* **Showing product images:**
  "I show the main product image and some small thumbnails below it. Users can click on thumbnails to see different images."

* **3D model integration:**
  "I added a special 3D viewer that shows the product as a 3D model. This viewer lets users rotate and zoom the model to see the product from all sides."

* **Switch between images and 3D:**
  "Users can switch between regular images and the 3D view by clicking a 3D button. When the 3D view is active, it replaces the main image."

* **Loading the 3D viewer library:**
  "I included an external JavaScript library called `model-viewer` dynamically to handle the 3D rendering."

* **Extra features:**
  "I also implemented loading spinners, toast notifications for actions like adding to cart or wishlist, product rating stars, stock status, and quantity control."

***3. How it works technically (brief):***

> "When the product page loads, it calls APIs to fetch product details and images. It sets the main image to show first. If the user clicks on the 3D button, it activates the 3D viewer with the model URL. The model viewer is loaded from an external source and allows automatic rotation and user-controlled camera movements."

**4. Why this is important:**

> "This 3D model feature helps users better understand the product by seeing it in 3D, which can improve engagement and sales."

### Critical questions the evaluator might ask:

1. **How did you load and display the 3D model?**
   *Answer: I used the `<model-viewer>` web component from Google, loaded via a script dynamically. It takes a `.glb` 3D model URL and shows it with controls.*

2. **How do you handle switching between images and 3D model views?**
   *Answer: I keep a boolean variable `is3DViewActive`. When it's true, I show the model viewer. When false, I show regular images. Clicking thumbnails or the 3D button toggles this.*

3. **What format does the 3D model use and why?**
   *Answer: The model uses `.glb` format because it's compact and supported well by model-viewer.*

4. **What happens if the 3D model URL is missing or the model fails to load?**
   *Answer: I set a default model URL initially. If no model URL is provided, the viewer shows the default model. Error handling for load failure can be improved.*

5. **How do you optimize loading times with 3D models?**
   *Answer: The model is loaded only when the user switches to 3D view, so it doesn't slow down the initial page load.*
