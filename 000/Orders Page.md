### 1. Introduction: What is this feature?

Start by clearly stating the purpose of the feature.

"Good morning/afternoon. The feature I'll be explaining today is the **'My Orders' page**. This page allows users to view a complete history of all their past orders, track their status, and perform actions like cancelling orders or reviewing products."

### 2. Overview: The User Experience

Describe the main sections and what a user sees.

"When a user navigates to 'My Orders,' they will see a list of all their orders. Each order is presented clearly with important details, and they can interact with individual items within those orders."

### 3. Deep Dive: Displaying Orders

Explain how orders are loaded and presented.

"Let's look at how orders are displayed:
* **Loading Orders:** When the page loads, it immediately fetches all orders associated with the logged-in user from the backend. While fetching, a **loading spinner** is shown to indicate that data is being retrieved, improving the user experience.
* **Order Grouping:** All related items for a single order are grouped together.
* **Order Details:** For each order, I display key information at a glance:
    * **Order Placed On:** The exact date the order was made.
    * **Total Amount:** The grand total for the order, including products, shipping, and taxes.
    * **Order Status:** The current status of the order (e.g., 'Shipped', 'Delivered', 'Cancelled'). I've also added visual cues, changing the color of the status based on its value for better readability.
    * **Delivery Address:** A quick view of where the order was shipped. Users can hover over the name to see the full address details in a **tooltip**.
* **Order Items:** Below the main order details, each product within that order is listed with its image, name, quantity, and individual price."

### 4. Deep Dive: Order Actions and User Interactions

Now, explain the interactive parts, like cancelling, rating, reviewing, and downloading invoices.

"Users can perform several actions from this page:
* **Cancel Order:** For eligible orders (typically those not yet delivered or already cancelled), users can click a 'Cancel Order' button. Before cancelling, a **confirmation prompt** appears to prevent accidental cancellations. If successful, the order's status is updated to 'Cancelled', and a **toast message** confirms the cancellation and refund information. I've also added logic to prevent cancelling orders that are already delivered or already cancelled.
* **Download Invoice:** Users can download a detailed invoice for any order that hasn't been cancelled. Clicking the 'Download Invoice' icon generates an HTML invoice, which then opens in a new window for easy printing or saving. This invoice includes all product details, quantities, prices, and a breakdown of totals, including subtotal, shipping, and GST.
* **Rate Product:** Once an order is 'Delivered', users can rate individual products. Clicking 'Rate Product' opens a **modal window**.
    * Inside the modal, users can select a rating from 1 to 5 stars.
    * I've included **client-side validation** to ensure a rating is selected before submission.
    * After submission, a confirmation message is shown, and the modal closes automatically.
* **Review Product:** Also for 'Delivered' orders, users can write a text review for a product. A separate **review modal** opens, allowing them to type their feedback.
    * Similar to rating, I've implemented **validation** to ensure the review text isn't empty.
    * Upon successful submission, a confirmation message appears."

### 5. Error & Empty States

Explain how your UI handles different data scenarios.

"I've also handled various states of the page:
* **Error State:** If there's an issue fetching orders or order items from the backend, an **error message** is displayed to the user.
* **Empty State:** If a user has no orders yet, a clear message and an icon are shown, encouraging them to 'Start Shopping'."

### 6. Technical Details (Briefly)

Mention the technologies and architectural patterns.

"Technically, this feature uses **Angular components** (`ViewOrdersComponent`) to manage the UI and logic. It communicates with backend **services** (`OrderService`, `RatingService`, `ProductService`) to fetch and update data, ensuring a clear separation of concerns. I've utilized Angular's **structural directives (`*ngIf`, `*ngFor`)** for dynamic content rendering and **event binding (`(click)`)** for user interactions. For managing order items efficiently, I've implemented **grouping logic** in the component."

### 7. Challenges and Learnings (Optional but Recommended)

Share your insights and growth.

"One of the interesting challenges was accurately grouping order items with their respective orders and ensuring all calculated totals (like in the invoice) were correct. Also, implementing the different modal pop-ups for rating and reviewing, along with their respective validations and submission flows, was a good learning experience in handling complex user interactions. I also focused on providing clear feedback to the user through toast messages for actions like order cancellation."
