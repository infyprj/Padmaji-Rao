When explaining your "Product Detail" feature, focus on the user experience, the core functionalities, and especially the technical details behind the 3D model rendering.

### 1. Introduction: What is this feature?

Start by clearly stating the purpose of the feature.

"Good morning/afternoon. The feature I'll be explaining today is the **'Product Detail Page'**. This page provides comprehensive information about a specific product, allowing users to view its details, interact with images, check stock, add to cart or wishlist, and critically, experience the product through an **interactive 3D model**."

### 2. Overview: The User Experience

Describe the main sections and what a user sees.

"When a user clicks on a product, they are taken to this page. Here, they'll find everything they need to make a purchase decision. The page is designed to be user-friendly, starting with a prominent display of the product, followed by all its essential information and interactive elements."

### 3. Deep Dive: Product Visuals (Concentrate on 3D)

This is where you shine, focusing on the 3D model.

"Let's dive into the visual presentation of the product, which is a key part of this feature:
* **Loading State:** Initially, a **loading spinner** is displayed to indicate that product data is being fetched, ensuring a smooth user experience.
* **Main Product View:** The largest area on the left is dedicated to showing the product. By default, it displays the product's main image.
* **Image Thumbnails:** Below the main view, there's a row of smaller thumbnails. Users can click these to switch the main display between different product images.
* **Interactive 3D Model Rendering:** This is a core innovation of my feature.
    * **Activation:** I've added a special thumbnail with a '3D' icon. When a user clicks this, the main product view transforms from a static image to an **interactive 3D model viewer**.
    * **Technology Used:** I integrated the **`<model-viewer>` web component**, which is a powerful and easy-to-use tool for displaying 3D models on the web. I loaded it dynamically using a script in `ngAfterViewInit` to ensure the component is available after the view initializes.
    * **Dynamic Model Loading:** The `src` attribute of the `<model-viewer>` component is dynamically bound to `product.modelUrl`, meaning each product can have its own specific 3D model. If a product doesn't have a specific model, a default one is used.
    * **User Interaction with 3D:** The `model-viewer` allows users to:
        * **Rotate:** `auto-rotate` is enabled, making the model spin slowly by itself, immediately showing its three-dimensional nature.
        * **Control Camera:** `camera-controls` allows users to drag their mouse or finger to manually rotate the model, zoom in and out, and pan around, giving them a complete 360-degree inspection of the product.
        * **Visual Enhancements:** I've also configured `shadow-intensity` and `exposure` to make the model look more realistic and well-lit within the scene."

### 4. Deep Dive: Product Information & Actions

Explain other vital parts of the page.

"Beyond the visuals, the page provides comprehensive product information and user actions:
* **Product Title & Price:** Clearly displays the product's name and its pricing, including the original price (struck through) and the discounted price, along with the discount percentage.
* **Average Ratings:** I've implemented a visual star rating system that dynamically displays the product's average rating based on user submissions. It also shows the total number of ratings received. If no ratings exist, a 'No ratings yet' message is shown.
* **Stock Status:** Users can quickly see if a product is in stock, low stock, or out of stock. I've used different icons and colors to provide immediate visual feedback. For out-of-stock items, a message and a 'Notify When Available' button are displayed.
* **Quantity Selector:** For in-stock items, users can easily adjust the quantity they wish to purchase using increment and decrement buttons, with checks to ensure the quantity doesn't exceed available stock.
* **Call to Action Buttons:**
    * **Add to Cart:** Users can add the selected quantity of the product to their shopping cart. A **toast notification** confirms the action or informs them if the item is already in their cart.
    * **Add to Wishlist:** Users can also add the product to their wishlist. Again, a toast notification provides feedback.
    * **Authentication Flow:** Both 'Add to Cart' and 'Add to Wishlist' check if the user is logged in. If not, they are redirected to the respective pages (cart or wishlist) which would then handle login prompts.
* **Product Description:** A detailed description of the product is provided for users to learn more."

### 5. Technical Details (Briefly)

Mention the technologies and architectural patterns.

"Technically, this feature is built as an **Angular component** (`ProductDetailComponent`). It uses **Angular's routing (`ActivatedRoute`)** to get the product ID from the URL. It communicates with backend **services** (`ProductService`, `CartService`, `RatingService`) to fetch product details, images, ratings, and to handle cart/wishlist additions. I've made extensive use of **Angular directives like `*ngIf` and `*ngFor`** for conditional rendering and looping through data, and **`[ngClass]`** for dynamic styling based on conditions like active thumbnail or stock status. The toast notifications are implemented to provide non-intrusive feedback to the user."

### 6. Challenges and Learnings (Optional but Recommended)

Share your insights and growth.

"One significant challenge and learning opportunity was seamlessly integrating the **3D model viewer**. I had to ensure it loaded correctly, handled dynamic model URLs, and provided a smooth interactive experience without impacting the rest of the page's performance. Handling various states like loading, error, and out-of-stock scenarios, along with providing clear user feedback through toast messages, also refined my skills in building robust and user-friendly interfaces."

## Critical Questions an Evaluator Might Ask

Here are some critical questions an evaluator might ask, especially concentrating on the 3D model rendering:

---

### General Understanding & Design
1.  "How do you determine the appropriate **`modelUrl`** for each product, and what happens if a product doesn't have an associated 3D model?"
2.  "What was the reasoning behind displaying the product rating *only* if the user role is not 3? Who is user role 3?"
3.  "You've implemented dynamic stock status indicators. How accurate and real-time is this stock information, and what backend mechanisms support it?"
4.  "Beyond the 'Notify When Available' alert, how would you build out a full notification system for out-of-stock products, considering user preferences and scalability?"
5.  "How do you handle currency formatting (`â‚¹{{ product.price }}`) to ensure it's correct for different regions or if your application were to expand internationally?"

---

### Technical Implementation (Focus on 3D)
6.  "You're dynamically loading the `model-viewer.min.js` script in `ngAfterViewInit`. What are the **performance benefits or drawbacks** of this approach compared to including it directly in `index.html`?"
7.  "The `<model-viewer>` component adds a significant amount of JavaScript. How did you ensure that its inclusion doesn't negatively impact the **initial page load time** for users who might not interact with the 3D view immediately?"
8.  "What are the **browser compatibility** considerations for `<model-viewer>`? Are there fallback mechanisms if a browser doesn't support WebGL or the required features?"
9.  "You have `auto-rotate` and `camera-controls` on the `model-viewer`. What other attributes or functionalities of `model-viewer` did you explore, and why did you settle on these specific ones?"
10. "How are the 3D models (`.glb` files) stored and served? What are the **file size considerations** for these models, and how might you optimize them for web delivery?"
11. "Could you discuss the **backend API for product images and models**? How does it differentiate between regular images and 3D model URLs?"
12. "What kind of **error handling** is in place if a 3D model fails to load (e.g., broken URL, corrupted file)?"
13. "Regarding the `addToCart` and `addToWishlist` functions, you get `userId` from `sessionStorage`. What are the **security implications** of storing sensitive user data like `userId` in `sessionStorage`? How would you recommend securing this in a production environment?"
14. "Explain the mechanism for the toast notifications, specifically how `toastStatus` determines the styling (`toast-success` vs. `toast-warning`)."
