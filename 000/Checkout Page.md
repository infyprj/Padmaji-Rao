## How to Explain Your Project Feature

When explaining your "View Checkout" feature, think of it as telling a story about a user's journey. Keep it simple, clear, and focus on the **why**, **what**, and **how**.

### 1. Introduction: Setting the Stage

Start by briefly introducing the purpose of this feature.

"Good morning/afternoon. Today, I'll be presenting the **Checkout Page** feature of our application. This page is crucial for our users to finalize their purchases by selecting a delivery address and reviewing their order before placing it."

### 2. Overview: The User Experience

Describe the main parts of the page from a user's perspective.

"The checkout page is divided into two main sections:
* On the **left side**, users can manage their **delivery addresses**.
* On the **right side**, they see a detailed **order summary**."

### 3. Deep Dive: Delivery Address Management

Now, go into detail about the address section, highlighting the functionalities you implemented.

"Let's start with the **Delivery Addresses** section.
* **Displaying Addresses:** When a user arrives here, the system automatically fetches and displays all their saved addresses. We highlight the first address by default, making it easy for the user to pick one.
* **Adding New Addresses:** If a user wants to ship to a new location, they can click the '**Add New Address**' button. This brings up a **modal form** where they can enter all the necessary details like their name, phone number, full address, city, state, postal code, and country.
    * **Validation:** I've implemented **client-side validation** for all fields. This ensures that the user enters valid information, like a 10-digit phone number or a 6-digit postal code, and that required fields aren't left empty. This helps prevent errors before data even goes to the server.
* **Editing Existing Addresses:** Users can also **edit** any of their saved addresses by clicking the 'Edit Address' button next to it. This re-opens the same modal form, but it's pre-filled with the existing address details, allowing them to make quick changes.
* **Deleting Addresses:** To keep their address list tidy, users can **delete** an address. When they click 'Delete,' a **confirmation modal** pops up to prevent accidental deletions. Once confirmed, the address is removed from their list.
* **Selecting an Address:** Users simply click on an address card to select it for their current order. The selected address is clearly marked."

### 4. Deep Dive: Order Summary and Placement

Next, explain the order summary and the logic behind placing an order.

"Moving to the **Order Summary** on the right:
* **Cart Items Display:** This section shows all the items currently in the user's shopping cart, including the product image, name, quantity, and the calculated price for that item.
* **Price Calculations:** I've implemented the logic to calculate:
    * The **subtotal** (total cost of all items).
    * **Shipping charges**: We offer **free shipping** if the subtotal reaches a certain threshold (e.g., â‚¹50,000 in this project); otherwise, a standard charge applies.
    * **GST (18%)**: This is calculated on the subtotal.
    * Finally, the **Order Total** is calculated by summing the subtotal, shipping charges, and GST.
* **Placing the Order:** The 'Place Order' button becomes active only when an address is selected and there are items in the cart.
    * When clicked, the system sends an order request to the backend, including the user's ID, cart ID, and the selected address ID.
    * **Order Confirmation/Error Handling:** Once the order is successfully placed, the page changes to a success screen, confirming the order and offering options to 'View My Orders' or 'Continue Shopping.' If there's an issue during order placement (like an empty cart, invalid address, or insufficient stock), I've implemented comprehensive **error handling** to provide specific feedback to the user."

### 5. Technical Details (Briefly)

You can briefly touch upon the technologies and methods used.

"From a technical perspective, this feature is built using **Angular**, leveraging:
* **Components** for modularity (e.g., `ViewCheckoutComponent`).
* **Services** (`AddressService`, `CartService`, `OrderService`) to interact with the backend API for fetching and updating data.
* **Angular Forms (NgModel)** for handling user input and validation in the address modal.
* **Conditional rendering (`*ngIf`)** and **loops (`*ngFor`)** for dynamically displaying content."
